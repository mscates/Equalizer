### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the background position property to align an image. I also used relative and absolute positioning with percentage value instead of pixels to make the design more responsive. It was much easier than my first attempt.

### Continued development

I am getting better with flexbox, but want to practice this some more. I also am excited about css grid. also, need to decrease the time it takes to complete the project.
